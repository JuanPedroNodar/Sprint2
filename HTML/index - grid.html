        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

        <p>
          ¨ Before joining the bootcamp, I´ve never written a line of code. I
          needed sorme structure from professionals who can help me learn
          proqramming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to waint long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learninq to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I´ve
          often referred to ir during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          devoleper after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!¨
